# Flashlight Lite
Flashlight Lite is an Android flashlight application wih a small footprint. 

It enables you to turn your flashlight with just one hand without even looking at your device. Just shake the phone two times, say the magic word, and it will turn the flashlight on or off. It has an optimized battery usage and it won't drain your battery. What's not to love about it?

* Shake detection is active when the lock screen is active, e.g. the phone is locked and the screen is lit up.
